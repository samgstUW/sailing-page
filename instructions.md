When sailing, it is not all about letting the wind push you in the direction it is blowing.
The diagram above illustrates the boat and sail positioning depending on the point of sail.

It's good practice to make sure you understand where the wind is coming from before you set sail. 

To begin gaining momentum, the front of your boat should be pointed somewhere between 45 and 90 degrees
away from the direction the wind is blowing. Pay attention to the shape of the sail, and hold the boom so that it
catches the wind and the fabric does not flap around. Once it catches the wind, you will feel the sailboat lean over a bit as
the wind begins to propel your boat forward. 

Unless you are sailing downwind (the running position), or your destination matches your point of sail, you will usually 
have to sail in a zig zag pattern to reach particular destination using the wind. To do this, you will have to perform a maneuver called
a "tack". 

Tacking is when you quickly change the point of sail by turning through the wind. With enough momentum,  the boat will shift over to the other
side and pick speed back up.
