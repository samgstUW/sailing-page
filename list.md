# Things Needed

* **A sailing dinghy**
  * This seems obvious, but you need a boat of some sort with a sail if you are going to travel anywhere on the water!
* **A life jacket**
  * Safety first! Even if you can swim, you should always have this when going out on the water. 
* **A paddle**
  * While you shouldn't *need* to use this, no sailor wants to get stuck in a marina or cove that they can't get out of.
* **A nice breeze and fair weather**
  * Doldrums aren't any fun. If there is no wind, or the weather is trecherous, maybe stay on land for the day.
